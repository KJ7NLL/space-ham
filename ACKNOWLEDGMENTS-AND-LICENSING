## Acknowledgements and Licensing Considerations

To whom it may concern:

It is our intention to license the space-ham code under GPL3, however, in the
course of developing space-ham there we worked from examples provided by
Silicon Labs:

	https://github.com/SiliconLabs/peripheral_examples

The space-ham project has, from time-to-time, copied functions verbatim from
the example tree and modified them to fit this application.  While we believe
that those examples have changed sufficiently and specific for the purposes of
this project to include them under the GPL3 as new work, we acknowledge that
the original sample implementation and hardware-level interactions were taken
from samples provided by Silicon Labs under the SPDX license.

Should any conflict arise between the GPL3 license of space-ham and the
SPDX-licensed examples that were referenced or modified from the examples
referenced above, then we acquiesce to the inclusion of any such conflicting
functions under the SPDX license to the minimum possible extent.  If such a
determination is made in the future then only those conflicting functions will
be moved to their own source files with an SPDX license header at the top.

It is our intention to follow the restrictions set forth in the SPDX license
while maintaining GPL3 as the intended license for the space-ham project
itself.  The SPDX license is included for reference as follows:

	""
	SPDX-License-Identifier: Zlib

	The licensor of this software is Silicon Laboratories Inc.

	This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied
	warranty. In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages
	arising from the use of this software.

	Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
	including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
	freely, subject to the following restrictions:

	1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not
	   claim that you wrote the original software. If you use this software
	   in a product, an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be
	   appreciated but is not required.
	2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
	   misrepresented as being the original software.
	3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution.
	""

The inclusion of the SPDX license above is for reference only: The authors of
space-ham interpret "this software" as referenced in the SPDX license above to
mean "only that software developed by Silicon Labs in the peripheral examples
linked above"; such inclusion of the SPDX license for reference shall neither
assert nor imply the licensor (or authorship) of space-ham.

Accordingly: we assert by response, in turn, that this license is met as
follows:

	1. The content of this file provides such notice to meet SPDX Restriction #1.

	2. To our knowledge, no single source file from the examples was taken
	   verbatim. As such, no source file is considered an "altered source
	   version".  However, functions from the examples were pasted into our
	   code and modified for space-ham's purpose as a starting point.  We
	   acknowledge that any function in the space-ham code base that
	   reasonably matches the format from a "peripheral_examples" (linked
	   above) provided by Silicon Labs is _not_ "original software".
	   This response item #2 meets SPDX Restriction #2.

	3. SPDX Restriction #3 is not applicable here, as we have not used any
	   SPDX-liensed source file in space-ham in its entirety; thus, neither
	   removal nor alteration is possible.  However, if this assertion is
	   found to be incorrect, then the content of this file contains the
	   original SPDX license above to meet SPDX Restriction #3.

In addition, we based this project on the Ryan Kurte's amazing (!) efm32-base
framework, available here:

	https://github.com/ryankurte/efm32-base/

Ryan Kurte notes the following considerations about licensing for projects
importing the efm32-base tree as a module:

	Since this is a combination of a number of Silicon Labs (ex. Energy
	Micro) components, as well as custom additions, licensing is a little
	interesting. A summary of the licenses involved follows, but I take no
	responsibility for the accuracy or interpretation of such.  

	The CMSIS Core falls under a fairly permissive ARM
	[license](cmsis/Include/arm_common_tables.h). This requires that the
	license requires the copyright and license note to be distributed in
	the documentation accompanying binary distribution, and that the name
	ARM LIMITED may not be used to promote any products derived from this
	without written permission.  

	The device and emlib components fall under the above ARM license
	(startup files) as well as a permissive Silicon Labs
	[license](device/EFM32GG/efm32gg280f1024.h). This allows use,
	alteration and distribution for any purpose provided the origin of the
	source is not represented, altered versions are plainly marked, and the
	notice is not removed from the source distribution.  

	Drivers are covered by the [Silabs License
	Agreement](drivers/Silabs_License_Agreement.txt). This is similar to
	the the license above, however prohibits sublicensing the included code
	and use of the code on non-silabs devices.  

	The CMake components of this project are distributed under the MIT
	license.  

	What does all this mean?  
	 * Commercial use is not a problem (as you would expect)
	 * Licenses need to be distributed with device binaries
	 * Unless you are using the Driver module (ie. USB) you can probably re/sublicense things.
	 * I have no idea how this interacts with common FOSS licenses :-/

We are doing our best to acknowledge original authorship where appropriate and
it is our intention to follow the licenses of other authors where appropriate.

Sincerely,

Eric Wheeler, KJ7LNW
